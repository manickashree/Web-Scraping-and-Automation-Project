# Craigslist Scraping
## Overview<br>
This project involves web scraping with Python to target the "free" category in the San Francisco Bay Area section of Craigslist. Additionally, it includes automating the login process for The Old Reader, leveraging skills similar to those used in our previous Neopets project.

## Goals
1. Scrape and save the first 250 free item listings from Craigslist. <br>
2. Parse and display detailed information from the saved HTML files.<br>
3. Automate login procedures for The Old Reader using Python.<br>
